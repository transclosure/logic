Question 2

The runtime of this algorithm can be exponential because of our naive resolution 
application without backtracking. Consider an example of 2^(k)-1 clauses and k
variables. The clause set consists of all possible 2^(k) clauses of size k, except
for the fully negated clause. This clause set will always be satisfied by setting
all variables to true. Almost every clause will have another clause to resolve to
for every variable k. Our naive algorithm with apply resolution to each clause pair,
resulting in an exponential runtime in the number of variables.


Question 3

If a clause contains p and -p, it is tautologous. Therefore, we can remove this
clause from the set as it will not affect satisfiability.

Question 4

If the clause set is satisfiable, the resolution algorithm will produce a set of
satisfiable non-empty clauses that can be used to produce a truth assignment 
similar to DPLL.
